\begin{quote}[Katie Makkai][flushright]
``The word pretty is unworthy of everything you will be. And no child of mine will be contained in five letters. You will be pretty intelligent, pretty creative, pretty amazing. But you will never be merely pretty.''
\end{quote}

\lettrine[nindent=0em]{W}{hen} I was just a little girl, I asked my mother, ``What will I be? Will I be pretty, will I be pretty, will I be pretty?!'' What comes next? Oh right, will I be rich -- which is almost pretty depending on where you shop. And the pretty question infects from conception passing blood and breathe into cells. The word hangs from our mothers hearts in a shrill fluorescent floodlight of worry. Will I be wanted? Worthy? Pretty?
